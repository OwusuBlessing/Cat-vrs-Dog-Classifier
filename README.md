* JavaScript

## Project Description
The data image datasets  was colleted from kaggle by using the kaggle Api because that happend to be a faster way to get image datasets.The images which are are int two classes were properly prepprocessed and the trained on Keras model.The model performed quite well and gave an accuracy of about 93%.All the operations are carried out on google collaboratory platform

## Needs of this project
