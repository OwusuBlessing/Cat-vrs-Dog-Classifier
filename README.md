# Cat vrs Dog Image Classifier
This is a simpple deep learning  Flask app trained on top of Keras APi.The trained model will take an input image and predict the class between Dog and Cat

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is is to complete my certification on free code camp as it is one of the six projects requiired to acquire the certificate
### Methods Used
* Image Data collection 
* Data preprocessing
* Model Building and Evaluation
* App development

### Technologies
* Python
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Flask
* HTML,CSS
* JavaScript

## Project Description
The data image datasets  was colleted from kaggle by using the kaggle Api because that happend to be a faster way to get image datasets.The images which are are int two classes were properly prepprocessed and the trained on Keras model.The model performed quite well and gave an accuracy of about 93%.All the operations are carried out on google collaboratory platform
